			The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) is Ireland’s largest sporting
			organisation. It is celebrated as one of the great amateur sporting
			associations in the world.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			It is part of the Irish consciousness and plays an influential role in
			Irish society that extends far beyond the basic aim of promoting Gaelic
			games.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			It was founded on November 1, 1884, at a meeting in Thurles, Co.
			Tipperary, by a group of spirited Irishmen who had the foresight to
			realize the importance of establishing a national organisation to make
			athletics more accessible to the masses and to revive and nurture
			traditional, indigenous sports and pastimes. At that time, it was largely
			only the gentry and aristocracy who were allowed to meaningfully
			participate in athletics.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			Until then, all that was Irish was being steadily eroded by emigration,
			intense poverty, and outside influences. Within six months of that famous
			first meeting, GAA clubs began to spring up all over Ireland, and people
			began to play the games of Hurling and Gaelic Football and take part in
			Athletic events with pride.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			The Association today promotes Gaelic games such as Hurling, Football,
			Handball, and Rounders and works with sister organisations to promote
			Ladies Football and Camogie. The Association also promotes Irish music,
			song, and dance and the Irish language as an integral part of its
			objectives. The GAA has remained an amateur Association since its
			founding. Players, even at the highest level, do not receive payment for
			playing, and the volunteer ethos remains one of the most important aspects
			of the GAA.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			The organisation is based on the traditional parishes and counties of
			Ireland. As a community-based organisation, it is often stated that it is
			difficult to determine where the community ends and the GAA club starts as
			they generally overlap and are intertwined. The GAA has over 2,200 clubs
			in all 32 counties of Ireland.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			Every summer, the inter-county All-Ireland Championships in hurling and
			football capture the attention of the Irish public, and regional towns
			heave with the arrival of large numbers of supporters and the colour,
			noise, and excitement that they bring. In the region of 1.5 million people
			attend the GAA Championships from May to September.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			However, by far the two biggest days in the GAA calendar are the
			All-Ireland finals in hurling and football. A sellout attendance of 82,300
			is guaranteed in Croke Park, and the quest for tickets is intense as
			Ireland’s top counties do battle for the right to be All-Ireland
			champions. The finals are broadcast around the world. The GAA has
			developed abroad amongst the Irish Diaspora. The Irish who emigrated
			brought their national games with them, and both regional and club units
			are now well established in the United States of America, Australia,
			Britain, Canada, China, mainland Europe, and many other parts of the
			world.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			400 clubs promote the activities of the GAA around the world. As with all
			aspects of Irish society, the GAA has undergone many changes in the past
			40 years. Among the first major changes to take place was the removal of
			‘the Ban’ in 1971, which had prevented members of the Association from
			playing or attending a number of other sports such as soccer and rugby.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			In more recent times, changes have been made to the rule which prevented
			members of the Security Forces in the north of Ireland from becoming
			members of the Association, and the rule which limited the playing of
			games at Croke Park and all other Association venues to only those
			controlled by the Association. At the 2005 Annual Congress, a vote was
			passed to allow international rugby and soccer matches to be staged at
			Croke Park for the first time for the duration of the redevelopment of
			their traditional venue at Lansdowne Road.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			Huge changes have also taken place in the structure of the GAA’s
			inter-county Championships. For 110 years, the All-Ireland Championships
			had been run on a purely knockout basis. In 1997, a new system meant that
			for the first time a team who had suffered a defeat could still win the
			All-Ireland hurling title, as losing provincial finalists were re-entered
			in the competition. In 2001, the Football Championships adopted a similar
			approach. The result was the most exciting Championship in years and a
			dramatic increase in the number of quality games at national level for GAA
			fans.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			With a marked increase in attendances and the need to market the games
			more fervently, the GAA invested heavily in the development of its
			grounds. Indeed, it has been estimated that the GAA has invested (in
			current purchasing power) the equivalent of €2.6 billion in its nationwide
			infrastructure at national and local levels in the past 50 years. The
			result is that the vast majority of GAA clubs, even in the most rural
			areas of Ireland, have developed and enjoy ownership of their own grounds
			and associated facilities.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			However, it is the Association’s Headquarters at Croke Park which has been
			the subject of the most dramatic redevelopment. The stadium has been
			thoroughly modernized in a rebuilding project that took place between 1993
			and 2005, and the stadium’s capacity was increased from 64,000 to 82,300
			and is now considered to be among the most modern stadiums in Europe. It
			stands today as a monument to the selfless work and dedication of the
			GAA’s enormous legion of volunteers.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			Further change for the Association has followed the publication of the
			Association’s Strategic Vision and Action Plan 2009-2015. It charts a path
			for the Association across the wide spectrum of its activities, and many
			of the goals set out have already been realized. Many of Ireland’s most
			prominent personalities over the years have been well known for their
			exploits on the GAA fields.
		</p>

		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 text-gray-700">
			Former Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Jack Lynch won a record six All-Ireland
			medals-in-a-row, five in hurling (1941-44 and 1946), and in 1945 in
			football with his native Cork. John Wilson, a former Tánaiste (Deputy
			Prime Minister), won an All-Ireland football medal with Cavan at the Polo
			Grounds, New York, in the only All-Ireland final played outside Ireland.
			Several current members of Parliament also played the games at the highest
			level, and Minister of State for the Diaspora, Jimmy Deenihan T.D., won
			five All-Ireland football medals and captained the Kerry team in 1981. The
			father of An Taoiseach Enda Kenny, Henry Kenny, won an All-Ireland
			football medal with Mayo in 1950.
